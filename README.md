# Maria - Backend Architecture Project

## 🚀 Overview

Maria is a backend system designed with clean architecture principles, focusing on modularity, scalability, and maintainability. This project showcases the design patterns, modular structures, and backend logic handling that are crucial in building highly reliable systems at scale — perfectly aligned with real-world large-scale payment systems and distributed architectures.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- Clean and modular backend architecture
- Efficient request handling and data retrieval pipelines
- Separation of concerns using layered architecture
- Asynchronous operations for better performance
- Easily extensible for new modules and integrations

## 💡 Tech Stack

- **Language:** JavaScript (Node.js), Python
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic UI for demonstration)
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Package Management:** npm
- **Version Control:** Git

## 🔍 System Design Highlights

- Backend-first design for data-centric applications
- Clean separation between business logic, API routes, and data layers
- Demonstrates how scalable APIs can be designed and extended
